\description{
The \code{proton} function is used for solving problems in the data-based game ,,The Proton Game''.
Solve four data-based puzzles in order to crack into Pietraszko's account!
}
\details{
Every time when some additional hints are needed one should add
\code{hint=TRUE} argument to the \code{proton} function.

In order to get more information about a user on the Proton server
one should pass \code{action = "login"}, \code{login="XYZ"} arguments
to the \code{proton} function.

In order to log into the Proton server one should pass \code{action = "login"},
\code{login="XYZ"}, \code{password="ABC"} arguments to the \code{proton} function.
If the password matches login, then one will receive a message about successful login.

In order to log into a server different from Proton one should pass
\code{action = "server"}, \code{host="XYZ"} arguments to the \code{proton} function.
