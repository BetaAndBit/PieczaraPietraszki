Description: 'Infiltration of the proton server' is a console-based game for data scientists.
  Act as a data-hacker and find Slawomir Pietraszko's credentials to the proton server.
  You have to solve four data based puzzles to find the login and the password.
  There are many ways to solve these puzzles, but you will need to try loops and instructions for data filtering, ordering and aggregation.
  Just the basics knowledge of R is required to play the game. But the more functions you know, the more approaches you can try.
  The knowledge of dplyr is not required but may be very helpful.
  This game is linked with the ,,Pietraszko's Cave'' story available at http://biecek.pl/BetaBit/Warsaw.
