#' @title ,,Hack into Proton''
#'
#' @description
#' \code{proton} function enables a player to solve problems in ,,Hack into Proton'' game.
#' It is sufficient to solve four riddles in order to get into Pietraszko's account!
#' 
#' @param ... \code{proton} function is called by different arguments, which vary depending
#' on a riddle that we try to solve. See \code{Details} in order to get to know how the
#' whole list of arguments looks like.
#'
#' @details Every time when some additional hints are needed one should pass 
#' \code{hint=TRUE} argument to the \code{proton} function.
#' 
#' In order to get some more information about a user on the Proton server  
#' one should pass \code{action = "login"}, \code{login="XYZ"} arguments 
#' to the \code{proton} function.
#' 
#' In order to log into the Proton server one should pass \code{action = "login"},
#' \code{login="XYZ"}, \code{password="ABC"} arguments to the \code{proton} function.
#' If the password matches login, then one will receive a message about correct log.
#'
#' In order to log into a server different from Proton one should pass 
#' \code{action = "server"}, \code{host="XYZ"} arguments to the \code{proton} function.
